------------------

## Design Considerations

* Smart+Dart (or some other very fast) web application framework
* Redis + Postgres
* Elasticsearch
* JS API for developers to account for 
* Sign in to services like amazon & netflix & spotify & pandora
* No login or username creation like SONOS

## Random Thoughts

* Signed About Screen with sigs of all developers
* Pair up controllers
* Controllers can be metamorphic, driven by developers (since there are no physical buttons, it has a mic, touch, etc)
* Auto-tune for karaoke with phone mic.

## Hardware Models

* Lounge Starter
* Lounge GFX (good graphics card)
* Lounge Base (large harddrive)
* Lounge Ultanium
